Time - 12:12

I will attend all the condolences ceremonies from now on. May Josh's soul rest in peace. He always talked so sweetly to me. Showed up
to the gym everyday. He inspired me to be consistent in the gym when I started.

There have been moments in my days, brief moments where I can intentionally feel the wind touching my body. The beautiful landscape
in front of me. The music seems so much more pleasurable. I feel all these things and am grateful for them.

Have to decide on ordering a belt. I'll do it after going home and discussing with Dhruv. Ig I can manage here till then.
I'm coming after 3 July. I need 2 months to myself. Swimming on weekends. Developing in Java. 10 hours of sleep. Gym with Dhruv.
Driving Enfield listening to songs. Maybe I'll find someone and share that moment with them :) .Grateful for the opportunity to do
all these things in my life. Mabye last 3 years when I was grinding I was working towards these 2 months.
I won't pressure myself to do anything. No more forced internal sufferring. I care, I'm working towards not caring.

I don't know why to use Spring Boot instead of Express. I find Express way more convinient. But I'll still grind through Spring Boot
for now and make contributions to OpenMRS and many more organisations. I love Open-Source. Grateful for it.

I'm grateful for getting to sleep in AC.
I'm grateful for Block 6's night market.
I'm grateful for getting to spend those moments with Josh.
I'm grateful for the opportunity to learn Java development.
I'm grateful for the opportunity of those 2 months.
