Time - 9:38 am

Been getting weird/scary dreams ever since GSOC. Every single night. It feels like the anchor I was using is gone
and now I'm just drifting away in my thoughts. Weird. Probably need a new goal/adventure. At first they were just normal ghost dreams
but for the last 2 days the dreams have been about stuff that I avoided. I hope they keep coming. They make me reflect on stuff.

I'm grateful for Abhishek.
I'm grateful for the long walks.
I'm grateful for the times I joke with Arhan and pull his leg.
I'm grateful for Tom Platz - https://www.instagram.com/p/DHYs9bDozAG/ - and for his lived experience.
I'm grateful for myself for not giving up on life.

Let's see if the theory holds. The crest was pretty big, so I know that the trough is as well. Waiting to see what'll happen. 
I'll keep on moving forward.
