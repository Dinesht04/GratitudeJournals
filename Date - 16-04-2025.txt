Time - 13:42

I was very moved by Rita's death. I don't think I can watch Dexter anymore. April and May were supposed to be the rest periods of my life
after GSOC. But I'm unable to rest mentally. The subconcious pattern of finding problems with my life/myself keeps on repeating.
I will appreciate things more now, in the present. I though Dex had it all figured out, and I could follow him. My heart sinks when I think 
about Astor and Cody. I hope she rests in peace. I hope this is just a bad dream. Losing everything again, it will be very difficult. 
I don't know what will happen. It's the same gut wrenching feeling that I had when she stopped talking to me. I wonder why I got so attached
to Dexter. Why do I see myself in him. Not in a admiring way. I don't know why I resonate with him so much. 

I'm grateful for the opportunity to live.
I'm grateful for seeing my loved ones live their life and fulfill their dreams.
I'm grateful for Zoro.
I'm grateful for life, as this too shall pass when the sun will rise tomorrow.
I'm grateful for this moment right now.

Also lowkey proud of myself for finally talking to her.

Message to future:-
I think it's time to face the long standing insecurities and issues. 
I'll become strong enough to face them after I face and solve them, weird how life works.
I hope I love myself before my next romantic interest.
