I am grateful for Mondays, when I have freedom to do what I want.
I am grateful for the sunshine, and the warmth it provides.
I am grateful for realising that I have to set goals.
I am grateful for the physique I have.
I am grateful for the realisation that I don't have to change, but improve every aspect of my life.

I am not on the path. The goals have not been set, so I am kind of wandering, a boat with no sail, just going
with the currents. Will it take an event for me to set my goals? or will I do it naturally? I will let it come
to me naturally. I will let these things come  naturally to me, I'll do them in a more natural way. What is 
natural? Since I am natural, everything I do is natural automatically right?
