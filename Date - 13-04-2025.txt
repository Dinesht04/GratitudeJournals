I'm so goated. But I need to stop the bad pattern of measuring goatness by the girla/people I'm surrounded by.
How goated I am will be measured by my honesty and my actions.

I'm grateful for Uno with Ekansh Batra. I'm so grateful man. It is definitely top 10 funniest/enjoyable moments in my life.
Last night was a time to be grateful.
I'm grateful for my friends Siddharth, Ekansh and Sarthak.
I'm grateful for the 9 hour sleep.
I'm grateful for my parents who support me unconditionally in every adventure of life.
I'm grateful for my sister who is always by my side.

I'm nothing without these people. I may think that I'm so goated. I'll stand back up every time I fail at something.
No matter what life throws at my I'll never give up. But there is no 'I'. Just Family and friends.
