Title - Looking forward

Looking forward in life is so positive. 
By looking forward in life I can offset the negative internal dialogue and convert it into something 
useful and powerful. 
Maybe it's the otherway around - 
by getting stuck thinking about an event and ruminating about it constantly, it supresses my natural
positive looking forward motivated internal dialogue. 

I am grateful for the opportunities I have in life right now.
I am grateful for the opportunity to work on my physique.
I am grateful for the diet I can access right now.
I am grateful for the friends I can talk to.
I am grateful for the time I can spend with my family. - all the fun as well - Uno Flip hehe
I am grateful for the opportunity to practice jiu-jitsu.
I am grateful that I can call myself a Martial-Artist.
