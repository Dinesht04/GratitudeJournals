100kg for 5 squat wasn't smooth today. I might've loaded 110kg by mistake. Anyways I should get a belt,
better safe than sorry. I'm scared of developing that hospital backend in Java, so ig Java it is. Abs and 
veins are coming in nicely, but the cut is taking a toll on sleep which is affecting my mood. I wish there
was a holistic way to go through all this, but I recognise that is only a wish and I must grind through it
if I want to get a piece of that sweeeet swiss roll. I want to make a PR for that change on EncounterRole
before the weekend ends. Pressure is Privilege. I'm liking this haircut. Talked to her today as well hehehe.
Raider is going good but I have to add forearms as well. And I need to make use of that light day in 
between too. Or maybe I don't. I don't want mid back to be tight from all the pressing too. I can do back
recovery excercises on that day! We'll see. Haven't found a good tutorial for Java Rest as well. Gonna stick
with the freecodecamp one for now. Things are going well.

I'm grateful for the opportunity to workout.
I'm grateful for the opportunity to learn new things in tech.
I'm grateful for Siddhart.
I'm grateful for the lesson that you should do the things which seem hard.
I'm grateful for the these block 6 peaceful nights.
