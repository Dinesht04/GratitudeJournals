Maasi's website needs reveamp - Look at caratlane, bluestone, etc. Take what's reoccurring. That small business website as well.
Gumroad beehive for insp.
Probably a backend, Signup,Login, Forgor Password. Cart rememberance. Cloudinary for storing media.

OpenSource - Prolly gotta ask Claude how I can start working on OpenMRS' backend now that I have some idea on SpringBoot, have to
finish up SpringBoot as well. Prompt something like this - Project Tech Stack - Folder Structure - Some sample code - how do I
start contributing to this - change specific functions. The fact that I dont know JAVA dev that well is slowing things, but it's
alright. Not everything comes easy. Not everything is supposed to be easy. Nothing comes easy hahahahhaha. I'm being disingenous
for comedic purposes. A lot of things did come easily. I didn't take care of them properly.Wasn't grateful for those things. Am now.

OpenSource - Also setup another existing famous repo but with my tech stack this time. JAVA slowed down things in GSOC.
