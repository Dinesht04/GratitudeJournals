I am grateful for myself for sacrifing cheap dopamine thrills like:-
         instagram
         matsurbation
         having long and fun online chats with Pankh and Idra

I am grateful for myself for earning money so that I could feed the cats today.
I am grateful for the rest I am getting.
I am grateful for my will to form, achieve and keep on trying to achieve my goals.  
I am grateful for Harsh, Tushar and Vishwesh.
I am grateful for their 
                        friendships
                        the time we spend together
                        the laughs we share.

Things I can improve:-
    The vision is getting blurry. The perfect life. I need to draw and write again.
