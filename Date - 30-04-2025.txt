Time - 23:39

There is a lot less negative internal dialogue now, negligible.
I've realised I have to stick to the plan and see it out. No need jump paths the moment I find myself stable on one.
I'll just calmly see it out. Just peacefully living my life. Things on my mind are maasi's website, Zercher Squats, Barbell
Shoulder Pressing, rotating wrists while incline DB Press. I really want to visit Majnu Ka Tila this time. I'll also get 2-3
jerseys for myself.

Java dev won't come easy, I'll try to do it peacefully, without any negative self talk for fuel. Momentum and Acceleration.

I have a RTX computer. That's so crazy. I'm so grateful. Everything is at the grasp of my hand.

Can't watch One Piece, it sexualises Nami and Robin too much. Doesn't help the recovery process. It's like Apne Pair Pe Kulhadhi
Marna. Maybe I'll watch it with her.

I wonder if I'll come back to this college. See these faces again. Who knows, only time will tell. What I do know is that I'm
definetely doing Jiu Jitsu and Rock Climbing on the weekends. It's calm though, even if none of these things happen.
I'm just grateful for the pace in life right now.

I'm looking forward to GSOC's results but somewhere deep down I don't want to get selected. The goal was to only participate,
so that I could have confidence contributing to open source. If I get selected it will be a very long commitment. I want to do
some extra-curricular activities this summer and I think GSOC would mess it up highkey. Let's see what happens. Although I know
it is very unlikely I get selected.

I'm so grateful for my laptop. Even after 5 years I still can't believe I have RTX. Life's crazy.
I'm grateful for Chocobar. I can't believe I've been missing out on ts for 20 years.
Grateful for this moment, right now.
