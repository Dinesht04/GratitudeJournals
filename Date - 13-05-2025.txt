Time - 1:39

The accident fucked me up pretty bad.
Knee's gone, no gym for probably a month. No rock climbing either. Can't ride anymore.
Should go to Indrapuram and get it back soon. Chachi needs it for gym.

I love Tech. I love making stuff. I don't love a full stack website.
Been making this for too long. Too much mind resource and time resource has gone into this.
Will ship a managable version by tomorrow. After that I'm done with this.
Why am I doing it in the first place? To help her in any way I can. That's all I can do.
What she asks me. Should forget about my career or interests when it comes to this. I owe it to this
the gift of humanity given to me.

I have other moutains to climb. Go and CF. I knew I had to face it one day, no matter how much
I avoid it. I have to accept it, indulge in it. It's kind of like maths - idk.
Road to 150kg squat will have to wait.

I am grateful for the opportunity to face this challenge in life.
I am grateful for the hardships.
I am grateful for life.

Life isn't that hard anyways, dk why I'm feeling so gloomy about life. But she wears short skirts,
I wear T-shirts, She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers. HAHAHAHAHAHA - I'm getting back
on the enfield as I can walk again. CodeForces will be fun. I'll also learn 505 on guitar.
Have to find a problem statement about GoLang - ?? - Maybe an open source repo - ??? Can't think
of anything else. Don't have any exciting projects on my mind rn. GraphQL, WebRTC - Wanna try.
