Grateful for the opportunity to workout.
Grateful for the opportunity to get better at stuff.
Grateful for OpenMRS.
Grateful for never getting satisfied. It does get tiring at times. I never really appreciate what I have/have done in the moment,
but I do then I get stuck on it and the perspective shift changes from forward momentum to past dwelling. Kinda wild imagining
all my life with her. But I think when time comes, that perspective shift will come as well.
Grateful for all the beautiful girls in the world. If it wasn't for beatuiful girls or jacked badass Anime characters, I wouldn't 
be where I am in life.
